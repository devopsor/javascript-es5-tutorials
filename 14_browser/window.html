		/**********window***************/
		// JavaScript can get many objects provided by the browser and manipulate them.
		console.log('window inner size: ' + window.innerWidth + ' x ' + window.innerHeight);
		
		//Correspondingly, there is also an outerWidth and outerHeight attribute, which can get the entire width and height of the browser window.
		console.log('window outerWidth size: ' + window.outerWidth + ' x ' + window.outerHeight);
		
		
		/********navigator********/
		// The object represents information about the browser, and the most commonly used properties include:
		console.log('appName = ' + navigator.appName);
		console.log('appVersion = ' + navigator.appVersion);
		console.log('language = ' + navigator.language);
		console.log('platform = ' + navigator.platform);
		console.log('userAgent = ' + navigator.userAgent);
		
		// Note that navigator the information can be easily modified by the user, 
		// so the value read by JavaScript may not necessarily be correct. if Many beginners like to judge the browser version 
		// in order to write different codes for different browsers , for example:
		var width = window.innerWidth || document.body.clientWidth;
		console.log('width = ' + width);
		
		/********screen********/
		// The object represents the information of the screen, and the commonly used properties are:
		console.log('Screen size = ' + screen.width + ' x ' + screen.height);
		
		
		/********location********/
		// The object represents the URL information of the current page. For example, a full URL:
		console.log(location.href);

		/********document********/
		// The object represents the current page. Since HTML is represented as a tree structure in the form of DOM in the browser, 
		// the document object is the root node of the entire DOM tree.
		console.log(document.title);
		document.title = 'JavaScript Demo';
		console.log(document.title);
		
		var menu = document.getElementById('drink-menu');
		console.log(menu);
		var drinks = document.getElementsByTagName('dt');
		var i, s;

		s='Service Menu:';
		for (i=0;i< drinks.length;i++) {
		    s = s+drinks[i].innerHTML+',';
		}
		console.log(s);
		
		/********cookie**********/
		// Cookies are key-value identifiers sent by the server. 
		// Because the HTTP protocol is stateless, but the server needs to distinguish which user sent the request, 
		// it can use Cookie to distinguish. After a user successfully logs in, the server sends a cookie to the browser. 
		// For example user=ABC123XYZ(encrypted string)..., after the browser accesses the website, it will attach the cookie to the request header, 
		// and the server can distinguish the user according to the cookie.
		// Cookies can also store some website settings, such as the language in which pages are displayed, etc.
		console.log(document.cookie);
		// Since JavaScript can read the cookie of the page, and the user's login information is usually stored in the cookie, 
		// this creates a huge security risk, because the introduction of third-party JavaScript code into the HTML page is allowed:
		// To ensure security, server-side cookies should always be used when setting cookies httpOnly
		
		/********history**********/
		// The object saves the browser's history, and JavaScript can call historythe object's back()or forward (), 
		// which is equivalent to the user clicking the browser's "back" or "forward" button.
		// This object is a legacy object. For modern Web pages, due to the heavy use of AJAX and page interaction, 
		// simple and crude calls history.back()may make users very angry.
		// When beginners start designing Web pages, they like to be called when the login page is successfully logged in history.back(), 
		// trying to return to the page before login. This is a wrong approach.
		// Under no circumstances should you use history this object.

<!-- 
        Since the HTML document is a DOM tree after being parsed by the browser, 
        to change the structure of the HTML, it is necessary to manipulate the DOM through JavaScript. 

        Always remember that the DOM is a tree structure. 
        Operating a DOM node is actually the following operations:

        Update: 
        Update the content of the DOM node, which is equivalent to updating the HTML content 
        represented by the DOM node;

        Traverse: 
        Traverse the child nodes under the DOM node for further operations;

        Add: 
        Add a child node under the DOM node, which is equivalent to dynamically adding 
        an HTML node;

        Delete: 
        Delete the node from HTML, which is equivalent to deleting the content of 
        the DOM node and all the child nodes it contains.
-->

<!-- *********************************************************************************
    Before operating a DOM node, we need to get the DOM node in various ways. 
     The most common methods are 
     
     document.getElementById(): the ID is unique in the HTML document

     document.getElementsByTagName(): always returns an array of DOM nodes

     document.getElementsByClassName(): always returns an array of DOM nodes

 *************************************************************************************-->

<!-- 
    With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of 
    an HTML document.
    When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
    The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:
 
With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

    JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
-->

<!-- Add Dom: 
    Add a child node under the DOM node, which is equivalent to dynamically 
    adding an HTML node;

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Select the div element with 'app' id
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
      // Create a new H1 element
      const header = document.createElement('h1');
      // Create a new text node for the H1 element
      const headerContent = document.createTextNode('Develop. Preview. Ship. ðŸš€',);
      // Append the text to the H1 element
      header.appendChild(headerContent);
      // Place the H1 element inside the div
      app.appendChild(header);
    </script>
  </body>
